# Projecting, Plotting and Labelling Administrative Subdivisions (Project 3)

To create these maps of Laos, I extracted data from GADM and showed Laos' administrative divides as well as detailed shots of the provinces with their districts. 

## Deliverable 

Shows Laos as a whole along with the country's 17 provinces and it's respective district borders.

## Stretch Goals

### Stretch Goal 1

This map shows the data extracted from geoBoundaries and overall the map is similar to the map produced with data from GADM. The administrative districts from GADM and geoBoundaries are identical; however, the only difference between the GADM and geoBoundaries maps is the naming of Vientiane (the national capital of Laos). GADM, under ADM1, names the capital region "Vientiane [prefecture]", while geoBoundaries names it "Vientiane Capital".

Shows Laos' most populous province (Savannakhet) along with how the districts are divided.

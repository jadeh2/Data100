## Machine Learning and Recommender Engines in Streaming Sites

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that is capable of automatically learning and improving from experience and data. A subset of machine learning is recommendation systems. With the rise of the streaming services and online shopping, recommendation engines are extremely useful for filtering out irrelevant information in order to satisfy a customers’ or viewers’ tastes and preferences. 

A recommendation system is a data filtering tool that analyzes data to predict a users’ preferences in order to suggest relevant items that may spark interest to the user. Recommendation systems have three approaches: content-based filtering, collaborative-based filtering, and a hybrid approach. Content-based filtering is an approach that analyzes an individual users’ previous actions and explicit feedback in order to tailor to the users’ demonstrated interests. While collaborative-based filtering collects and analyzes data from a multitude of users and employs that data in order to predict the preferences of an individual user based on similarity. The hybrid model is a combination of these two approaches and through machine learning algorithms, the recommendation system automatically learns which recommendation strategy is best for each user.  

Recommendation engines are employed in many different sites and streaming services, such as Hulu, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Facebook, and Twitter; however, the most prevalent and globally known streaming service that utilizes recommendation systems is Netflix. 

With over 200 million active profiles and over 13,500 TV across its regional library, Netflix is tasked with recommending new titles that are potentially engaging to the viewer. Netflix employs a variety of algorithms, such as neural networks and probabilistic graphical models, in their recommendation systems; so, ultimately, they utilize the hybrid recommendation system when personalizing movie and TV show recommendations/rankings. Netflix personalizes both the movie/ TV show rankings (when scrolling through recommendations the top titles will show at the beginning) and even personalizes the thumbnails of the titles in order to showcase scenes or actors that may intrigue the user. Netflix collects data explicitly and implicitly as means of recommending titles tailored to the user. Explicit ways include analyzing the location, time of day, language, and device the user is watching: While implicit ways include analyzing viewer interactions with the streaming site (viewer ratings, viewing history, etc.), information about the title (genre, year of release, ect.), and viewers with similar watching preferences and tastes. Netflix then utilizes the data collected from all of their users to create a recommendation list that will satisfy an individual customer, which allows Netflix to profit from the customers’ continued subscription and is one of the keys to their success.

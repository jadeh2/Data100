# Data Fundamentals (Project 2)

To create this plot, I had to first obtain data from the Federal Census Bureau using an application program interface (API). Then I had to bind and convert the data to a long format and plot it using ggplot. The data shows the populaiton of the states in the USA according to the years 2000, 2010, and 2014.

## Part 2

For part 2 of project 2 I wanted to look into how the stocks differ among major electric car companies or companies that sell electric vehicles, especially with the rise of promotions for zero emission cars to encourage less pollution. Therefore, I decided to analyze stocks from Tesla, Nikola, Nio, BMW, and Volkswagon. I created the model to predict the stocks of Nikola (response variable), using the current stock prices of the other companies as the predictors. 

### Deliverable 1 (Plot)

This model reveals that there is generally a positive correlation between the car companies that only sell electric cars, such as between Nio and Tesla, showing that the R squared is closer to 1; however, the R squared is closer to 0 between the stocks that sell both electric and gas cars, such as between Volkswagon and Nikola. Additionally, R squared is closer to 1 between BMW and Volkswagon, which sell mainly gas cars.

## Part 3

For part 3 of project 2 I created a bar graph and line graph analyzing the returns and growth from Tesla, Nikola, Nio, BMW, General Motors, and Volkswagon stocks in the span of 2 years when investing $10,000. The bar graph describes the monthly returns of an example portfolio and the line graph describes the overall portfolio growth.  

### Deliverable 1 (Bar Graph)
This bar graph reveals that the monthly returns of these stocks started off low in 2019; however, an upward trend began in the beginning of 2020.

### Deliverable 2 (Line Plot) 
This line graph reveals that the monthly portoflio value when investing $10000 is generally positive. The portfolio value is static in the year of 2019; however, the value spikes in numbers in the middle of 2020, going from $10,000 to $25,000 in the months of May and July.

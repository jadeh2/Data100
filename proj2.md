# Project 2
## Data Fundamentals

To create this plot, I had to first obtain data from the Federal Census Bureau using an application program interface (API). Then I had to bind and convert the data to a long format adn plot it using ggplot. The data shows the populaiton of the states in the USA according to the years 2000, 2010, and 2014.

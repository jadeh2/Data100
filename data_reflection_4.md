## Random Forest Algorithm in Medicine 

The random forest algorithm is a tree-based method, or ensemble method, that is categorized as a supervised machine learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees (a diagram that demonstrates numerous outcomes from a series of decisions) and is used in predictive analytics. This algorithm utilizes bagging and feature randomness to create many uncorrelated decision trees in order to generate more accurate predictions and some of its advantages are that it can employ both classification (used in categorical data) and regression (used in continuous/ numerical data) tasks, handle large datasets, and accommodate missing or erroneous data values while maintaining accuracy. Due to the fact that the random forest method is relatively straightforward, this method is ubiquitous in nature and some of its applications include stock market price predictions, remote sensing, and object detection. 

Furthermore, an important and potentially life-saving use of the random forest algorithm is in predicting hypoglycemia in type 1 or type 2 diabetics. Diabetes is a life-threatening disease when untreated; therefore, machine learning techniques and other data science methods are pertinent in better caring for diabetes. The random forest method can be used to predict blood glucose (BG) levels, which can prevent hypoglycemic events (when blood levels are too low and cause confusion, shakiness, and in extreme cases seizures or death). Common occurrences of hypoglycemia include after physical activity or meals and overnight. Conversely, the random forest model can also predict BG levels to prevent hyperglycemic events (when BG is too high) and prevent complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage.

In multiple studies, researchers determined that utilizing the random forest algorithm is most effective in accurately determining BG levels and is the easiest to implement. With the random forest model, these researchers took primarily a data-driven approach where they analyzed and implemented the data from patients who used a continuous glucose monitor (CGM- monitors blood glucose levels at all times). The random forest model was then trained to separate the data values into various decision trees, using bagging/bootstrap aggregation, and after it predicts the BG value based on the aggregation method (used in cases of regression). 

Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence has significantly advanced management for diabetes and with increasing prevalence of these new technologies and models diabetes care will become increasingly easier to manage.

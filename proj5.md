# Acquiring, Modifying, and Describing the Data (Project 5)

To create these histograms and regressions models, I retrieved and imported data from the Worldpop website describing the geography (land use and land cover) of Laos. With this data, I created histograms describing how the land cover is affected by the population and also created linear models describing again how the population correlates with the geography of Laos. 

## Deliverables
### Histograms 

![deliverable1](ntl_desnity_plot.png)

Describes how the night time lights affects the density in Laos

![histogram](pop_density_plot.png)

Describes how the log population affects the density in Laos

![histogram2](water_density_plot.png)

Describes how the water affects the density in Laos

### Regression Models

![linear1](ntl_pop_linear.png)

Describes the correlation between the night time lights and the population in Laos

![linear2](pop_grassland_linear.png)

Describes the correlation between the grasslands and the population in Laos

#### Stretch Goal

![stretchgoal](linearmodel_stretchgoal.png)

As shown the R squared value is far from one; therefore, the correlation between the explanatory and response variable is very weak

## Machine Learning in Crime Prediction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that has become more prevalent as data sets are becoming larger and the need to classify and simplify these data sets increase. There are many types of clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and density based clustering; however, one of the most popular clustering methods is k-means method, a centroid based algorithm. The objective of k- means clustering is to group observations with similar characteristics and assign these groups into clusters. The k-means algorithm works by first specifying the number of clusters (K) and arbitrarily assigning data points into groups. The algorithm then computes the cluster centroids of each group, reassigns the data points into the closest cluster centroid, and recomputes cluster centroid according to the data point adjustments.  

 K- means clustering is one of the more simpler algorithms to implement and run; therefore, it is the most used among data analysts and other sorts of jobs due to its ability to handle large data sets and to be implemented in various applications. Some of the most common k- means applications include document classification, customer segmentation, insurance fraud detection, earthquake predictors, and crime predictors. 

The k-means method is pertinent in law enforcement in order to prevent crimes and predict probable crime locations. Examples of the extent k-means could be utilized in law enforcement  include its ability to identify locations frequented by crime and the conditions that could prompt these violent crimes, match gang activity with local incidents, and classify types of crimes and the age groups of each crime. When identifying probable crime locations, the k-means algorithm analyzes past crime locations to recognize the patterns, plots the crimes (robbery, kidnapping, murder, rape ,ect) on a map, then groups the data and determines the cluster centroid. The densely populated cluster centroids could then be potential crime locations and would want to be heavily surveillanced.  

Ultimately, k-means clustering is a very effective and versatile algorithm that allows people to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently; however, there are some disadvantages of employing this machine learning technique. Disadvantages include strong sensitivity to outliers and scale, difficulty in predicting the K value, and the fact that the order of data impacts the final results.

## Data and Human Development

With the advent of technology and humans' ability to collect large data sets, we are able to explain and answer universally renowned questions that could explain human behavior and their processes. As quoted by Aral, Georgescu-Roegen, and Geoff West, data can provide evidence, in quantifiable measures, to prove how and why economic and social complex systems function and its connection to human behavior. 

On a social scale, data can explain why humans live in certain areas and why towns or cities are built where they are now. Using geospatial data, we are able to analyze population densities and count to see where people live and cluster. These datasets that reveal population density can prove that humans tend to congregate near resources, such as rivers or other large areas of water, roads, and major settlements (cities) which create suburbs. Another example of where data is implemented is to explain why certain ethnic enclaves emerge in various areas of the United States. For example, the west coast states, like California and Hawaii, is densely populated with asian-americans; while, the southwestern states (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, ect.) is dominated by the hispanic-american population. This type of data, which can be collected through surveys, government reports, and other methods of data collection, can prove that a factor when choosing to immigrate to the US is determined by geographic location.  Ultimately, data can explain many social and environmental processes, ranging from why humans build towns and cities in certain areas and immigration patterns in the United State, United Kingdom, and other major countries. 

Furthermore, from an economic perspective, data science can explain and help decision-making in businesses and how overall economic systems function. Through predictive analytics and trends in markets, companies are able to make decisions that will best support their business and total revenue. Companies can analyze data of what people buy based on their preferences and other factors that are associated with human behavior. An example of how data can advance our understanding of economic systems is in stock markets. With data and predictive modeling, we are able to analyze and predict stock market trends of several different companies. For instance, among automotive industries, sales in non-emission vehicles are surging. Electric car companies, such as Tesla, Nio, and Nikola, are especially becoming popular as illustrated by their upsurge in stock market price. Data can predict this upward trend in electric car stocks and with this data we can conclude that consumers are gravitating towards the use of electric cars, whether that be for environmental reasons or because these products are in demand. Overall, data can connect economic decisions to human behavior and help companies adopt effective business practices. 

In conclusion, data science can advance our knowledge of human development and complex systems by analyzing and gathering large amounts of data. When given enough data, we can explain any type of situation or human process, despite the fact that human behavior is variable. Ultimately, as populations grow and technology revolutionizes data science and the methods of data collection, data will continue to improve human condition as our ability to handle and analyze large data sets advances.
